# LPJMM
Provide the code for the simulations and the real-world data application in the paper "A robust Bayesian latent position approach for community detection in networks with continuous attributes".

- The "data" directory includes all the data used in simulations and the real data application.

- The "source" directory includes R source files that are necessary to run the models (LPJMM and SNSM).

- The "jags_model" directory includes text files that store the jags model for LPJMM and SNSM.

To generate results from LPJMM and other models (SNSM, LPCM, and CSBM), run the code in "simulation 1,2,3,4" and "real data application" directories. 

To reproduce the results in the paper, see the session information for the settings.
